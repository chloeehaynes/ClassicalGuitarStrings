        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Chloe Haynes, and I am currently a junior studying computer science at Washington University in St. Louis. Aside from my major, I am also minoring in music and play classical guitar. Since I first picked up my first classical guitar in 2008, I have had to change my strings quite a few times. Until recently, however, I never had really thought about how different strings might affect the overall feel and sound of a guitar. To my surprise, every detail about strings – from the gauge to the material – had something to contribute.

        <p class = "caption">Washington University Guitar Gala (December 2021, moved to basement during a tornado warning). This was the guitar department's first recital since 2019, due to COVID-19. Here, I played Heitor Villa-Lobos's Prelude No. 1 (on a Cordoba Dolce guitar with D'Addario EJ46 strings).</p>
