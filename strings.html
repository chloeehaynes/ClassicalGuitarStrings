            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                If you play classical guitar, whether you are just starting out or have been playing forever, you probably know that choosing strings is an incredibly daunting task. By the time you sift through other types of guitar strings, like electric and acoustic, you are still left with a plethora of options. Then after you finally decide on a brand, you have to decide what model you would actually like to buy. Do different strings really make that much of a difference though? The short answer is yes. The different characteristics you run into on string packages do make a difference in how your guitar will feel and sound. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Where are you even supposed to begin though? To simplify things, we will focus on D’Addario strings, specifically their standard Pro Arté Nylon Core models. Known as a reliable string among many guitarists and offering multiple variations, they serve as a great example to study the nuances in guitar string sound and feel.

            <h3>How Strings Work</h3>
            <p>
                First, though,we will look at how all strings work. Strings work by vibrating, and then the frequency of this vibration determines the pitch <a href = "#source1">[1]</a>. While you do not need to memorize the exact details, it should not be taken for granted that this vibration creates the sound. For example, your ability to play an E on the guitar will not change whether you know the frequency of open E on the first string or not. However, knowing this fact provides more context for why things like tension and material do matter for the way a string produces sound.

        <h2>Materials</h2>
        <p>
            First we’ll look at material. D’Addario Pro Arté Nylon Core strings break this up into two categories: treble strings and bass strings <a href = "#source2">[2]</a>. Treble strings consist of the three highest strings on a guitar. From highest to lowest, their pitches are E, B, and G, which are the first, second, and third strings respectively. Then, the bass strings include the three lowest strings. These strings’ pitches are D, A, and E, for the fourth, fifth, and sixth strings. 
        </p>

        <div id = "treble">
            <h3>Treble Strings</h3>
            <p>
                To make treble strings, a machine extrudes out nylon in the exact diameter each string needs to be so that its vibration works properly for its pitch at the correct tension level <a href = "source3">[3]</a> (which we’ll cover later).  D’Addario makes these in clear nylon and black nylon <a href = "#source2">[2]</a>. Clear nylon is D’Addario’s basic, nylon polymer, and black nylon is that same base material with some black dye added in <a href = "source3">[3]</a>. So, while very similar, the addition of black dye to nylon actually changes the string’s composition just enough for there to be differences in tone, clarity, articulation, and stretchiness <a href = "source4">[4]</a>. However, as an overall sturdy material, both clear and black nylon can hold up against corrosion from external factors, especially moisture from a room’s humidity or your hands’ sweat. To see a side by side of these factors, see the table below.

                    <td>well protected</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <br>

            <p>
                Every guitarist has their own preference for tone, so depending on what sound you like best, either treble option can be favored. The same thing goes for stretchiness, since this tends to be more subjective from player to player. However, clear nylon provides higher clarity and more articulation, which makes it a more high quality string for most guitarists (unless you are attached to the tone that black nylon produces).
